# Sentiment Analysis
---
## üìù Project Description:
 - This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis application that can predict the sentiment of restaurant reviews as either positive or negative. The user can input a restaurant 
   review, select one of several machine learning models for sentiment classification, and receive a prediction of whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The application is 
   built using Streamlit for the frontend and various machine learning algorithms for the backend.
---
## üìú Overview:
 - The goal of this project is to create a web-based sentiment analysis tool that allows users to input restaurant reviews and get predictions on whether the reviews are positive or 
   negative. The tool is powered by several machine learning models, including popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and others. 
   The best-performing model for sentiment classification is chosen based on accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## üì¶ Dataset:
 - **Dataset Name:** Restaurant Reviews Dataset
 - **Source:** The dataset contains a collection of restaurant reviews, where each review is labeled as either positive or negative.
 - **Dataset Format:** The dataset is stored in a tab-separated value (TSV) file, where each row contains:
     - **Review:** A text field containing the restaurant review.
     - **Sentiment:** A binary target value (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
  The dataset has 1000 entries, which were used to train and test the models.

## üîç Data Preprocessing:
  The data preprocessing pipeline consists of several key steps to prepare the text data for machine learning models:

  - **Text Cleaning:**
      - Removal of special characters and digits using regular expressions (e.g., `re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)`).
      - Conversion of all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
  - **Tokenization:** Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
  - **Stopword Removal:** Removal of common but non-informative words (like "the", "is", etc.) using NLTK's list of stopwords.
  - **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run") using NLTK's `WordNetLemmatizer`.
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The `TfidfVectorizer` is used to transform the text data into numerical vectors that can be fed into machine learning models. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse 
    Document Frequency) helps in identifying important words in the text while down-weighting common words.

## üåê Streamlit Integration:
The frontend of the application is built using Streamlit, which provides a simple yet powerful interface for deploying machine learning models. The application includes:

- **Model Selection Sidebar:** Users can select different models from a sidebar to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Text Input Box:** Users can input a restaurant review that will be processed and classified.
- **Sentiment Display:** The predicted sentiment (Positive/Negative) is displayed with an appropriate emoji.
- **Background Customization:** A custom background image is added to enhance the user experience.
---
## üìà Result:
After processing the reviews and applying the trained models, the application predicts whether the review's sentiment is positive or negative. Based on the selected model, users can view the sentiment analysis result along with the model name.

For example:

 - Input Review: "The food was fantastic, and the service was great!"
 - Predicted Sentiment: Positive üòä (using Random Forest)
---
## üéØ Conclusion:
 - The sentiment analysis application is capable of providing accurate predictions for restaurant reviews based on the selected machine learning model.
 - The project successfully integrates multiple algorithms, providing users with flexibility in choosing the best model for the task.
 - Among the models tested, Random Forest and Logistic Regression show the highest accuracy, indicating strong performance for text classification tasks.
 - Streamlit is an excellent tool for deploying this machine learning model, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.
